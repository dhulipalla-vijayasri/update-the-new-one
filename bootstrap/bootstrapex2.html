    <h1 align="center">Career Advice for Students and Recent Graduates</h1>
    <hr>
    <p align="justify">A serious student’s main goal in life is to get a good and high paying entry-level job after completing their studies. The experience gained from that first job will help them move into a more successful one. Surveys state that one out of every two graduates remains unemployed. A few might be in a job that isn’t in their particular area of interest because they need to work just to cover their student loans. Several careers and financial experts say that universities could be a better place to find their dream job right after graduation. So planning is very important and should be started in a timely manner.</p>

    <h2 align="center">Five Ways to Boost Your Career Prospects</h2>
    <p align="justify">Some students have had dreams about their life career. However, many students haven’t given any thought to how to properly execute a plan to move into that career. This can also be hindered by large educational loans that need to be paid right away. Students may feel pressured to get another type of job to start paying off their loan instead of waiting for that dream job to open up.

        To overcome these challenges, it is advisable that students start working right after high school and through college to keep those overloaded expenses down. There are numerous job opportunities for high school students, too, which you can check out here. You may also want to try to check out online jobs, many of which don’t require a college degree.</p>
